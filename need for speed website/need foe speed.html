<p style="text-align:cursive;">Need for Speed: Most Wanted is a 2005 open-world racing video game, and
 the ninth installment in the Need for Speed series. Developed by EA 
 Canada and EA Black Box and published by Electronic Arts, it was 
 released on November 11, 2005, for PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, 
 Nintendo DS, Microsoft Windows, Game Boy Advance and Xbox 360. An 
 additional version, Need for Speed: Most Wanted 5-1-0, was released 
 in the same year for PlayStation Portable. The game focuses on street 
 racing-oriented gameplay involving a selection of events and racing 
 circuits found within the fictional city of Rockport, with the game's 
 main story involving players taking on the role of a street racer who 
 must compete against 15 of the city's most elite street racers to 
 become the most wanted racer of the group, in the process seeking 
 revenge against one of the groups who took their car and developing 
 a feud with the city's police department.</p><br>

<p>Most Wanted brought in many notable improvements and additions over 
other entries in the series, its major highlight being more in-depth 
police pursuits. Certain editions of the game were packaged with the 
ability for online multiplayer gaming. Upon its release, the game 
received positive reviews from critics and became a commercial success, 
selling 16 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best entries 
in the series as a result. Its success led to a collector's edition, 
Black Edition, which provided additional content for the game.</p><br>

<p>The game was succeeded by Need for Speed: Carbon in 2006, which provided
 a sequel to Most Wanted's story, with a virtual edition being made 
 available for PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Store in May 2012, 
 until it was discontinued the following year. A reboot of the game, 
 developed by Criterion Games, was released in October 2012.</p><br>

    <h2 id="section-2">PLOT</h2>
<p>
      The player arrives in Rockport as a newbie to the local street racing scene. Soon, the player becomes involved with the Blacklist, a list of the most notorious racers in Rockport, and proceeds to challenge Razor, the number 15 on the Blacklist. Due to their engine being sabotaged, the player loses the race, resulting in the loss of their BMW M3 GTR GT to Razor and becoming arrested by an approaching squad of the Rockport Police Department.

After being released by the police due to a lack of evidence, the player is helped by Mia, and is informed that Razor became the number one on the Blacklist, thanks to their newly acquired vehicle. From then, the player starts to climb up the Blacklist with the goal of defeating Razor once and for all.

After defeating Razor, Cross sends the entire RPD after the player, and informs them that they helped in the arrest of the Blacklist racers. Mia informs the player that Cross knows about their safehouses, and directs them to jump across a bridge north of Rosewood. The player makes the jump, evading the RPD.

In the final sequence, Cross logs in to the Rockport Police database and adds the player to the National Most Wanted list.
